NativeLibs4Java contains a few subprojects.

If you're in doubt concerning any of them or have specific enquiries, please [ask on the list](http://groups.google.com/group/nativelibs4java).

# Support sub-projects #

  * [JNAerator](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/) : see [JNAerator's License / Credit info](http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/wiki/CreditsAndLicense)
  * [BridJ](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/) : see [BridJ's License / Credit info](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/CreditsAndLicense)

# Bindings sub-projects #

  * [ScalaCL](http://code.google.com/p/scalacl/) : same license as BridJ (see [ScalaCL's FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/scalacl/wiki/FAQ))
  * [JavaCL](http://code.google.com/p/javacl/) : the original JavaCL is under LGPL, and the BridJ port is under BSD license
  * FFMpeg, WinRAR, Mono, BeaEngine, PThread and OpenCV subprojects : each can be assumed to bear the same license as its target library, as they're mostly auto-generated bindings and hence can be considered to be derived works of the native libraries' headers.
